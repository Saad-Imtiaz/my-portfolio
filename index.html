            <p> Hello! My name is Saad and I enjoy creating things that live on the internet.
                  My interest in <font color="#64ffda">Embedded Systems</font> and <font color="#64ffda">Front End Development</font> started back 
                    in 2016 when I decited to make a home automation system project in my bacholars degree
                    
                    - Turns out I have made microcontrollers as my pets.</p>

        <br>

            <p>  Fast-forward to today, and I've had the privilege of working in many start-ups and companies.
                My main focus these days is building an Energy Monitoring System for Industrial Applications at <a href="https://www.au.edu.pk">Embedded Systems Lab - AU</a> 
                .Also, I am working with multiple clients as a freelancer. </p>


            <p> Here are some technologies I have worked on : </p>
