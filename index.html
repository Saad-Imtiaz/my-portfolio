            <p class="aboutmep"> Hello! My name is Saad and I enjoy creating things that humans interact with.
                  My interest in <font color="#64ffda">Embedded Systems</font>
                   and <font color="#64ffda">Product Development</font> started back 
                   in 2016 when I decited to make a home automation system project during my bacholars degree
                    
                    - Turns out I fell in love with the world of microcontrollers.</p>
